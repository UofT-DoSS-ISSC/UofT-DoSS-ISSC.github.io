_May 2021_ 

We're excited to announce the second iteration of the _Independent Summer Statistics Community: Beyond Coursework_. Through this community, Department of Statistical Sciences students will have opportunities to build their professional statistical portfolio, connect with other students, increase their career preparedness and explore their options.

__Who is it for?__ All undergraduate students in a Department of Statistical Sciences (UTSG) PoST (including those about to graduate) or who took STA130 in Fall 2020/Winter 2021.
